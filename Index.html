OUR GOAL
We are not questioning the protocols gathering the data, nor are we trying to uncover any conspiracy. The goal of this website is to teach how inflation will affect you, and by how much to help you plan for your future. There will still be some averaging, depending on locations, stores, and how you manage your expenses, but at least you will get closer to the minimum inflation.
